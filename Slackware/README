Getting the sources
===================

Monotone
--------

The bleeding-edge source code is available both within and outside of I2P. The
I2P project uses Monotone to maintain the codebase.

Information on retrieving the source with monotone is available within I2P at
http://i2p-projekt.i2p/monotone and from the internet at https://geti2p.net/monotone.

Monotone 1.0 Slackbuilds are available at http://slackbuilds.org/.

Git
---

Git is also an option to retrieve the I2P source code. That said, Monotone is *the*
authoritative source. Known Git repositories with the I2P source include

- https://github.com/i2p/i2p.i2p
- http://git.repo.i2p/w/i2p.i2p.git (mirrored from Github)
- http://sourceforge.net/p/i2p/code/

Tarball
-------

The latest stable release is always available from the I2P homepage at
https://geti2p.net/get/.
